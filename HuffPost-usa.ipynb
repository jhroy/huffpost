       " Voters are wondering about the return policy for their “gifts”: A new poll finds Mitt Romney would beat Barack Obama if the election were held today. A congressman saved a child from choking to death, eliciting condemnation from Republicans who recalled freer times when Americans dislodged blockages in their windpipes without government assistance. And a federal court struck down D.C.'s handgun laws, meaning District voters can now demand voting rights at gunpoint.

       " Amtrak service resumed along the northeast corridor today, with coastal elites bravely hushing people in the quiet car, nobly pretending to accidentally sit next to attractive women and fearlessly purchasing hamburgers in bags. With congressional recess next week, lawmakers are suffering senioritis, caring even less about their jobs than usual. And Mitt Romney told college graduates during a commencement speech that fame and fortune are not the most important pursuits in life. He then apologized for arriving late from his celebrity boxing match with Evander Holyfield.

       " A reporter touched Hillary clinton’s knee, probably to investigate its role in telling her legs to stand down. Harry Reid says he likes everyone, even the fatties. And Skadden Arps employees are actively campaigning to have a group of street musicians near their office removed. If you ask us, the law should require them to take a two-year cooling off period.

       " Proving that the spirit of bipartisanship isn't dead, the 113th Congress is pretending it's the 114th Congress by approving the Keystone XL Pipeline. Several Senate Democrats didn't vote for Harry Reid to be minority leader -- which is to say, several Democrats will soon know what the true meaning of suffering is. And proving that some things never change, House Democrats managed to alienate a core constituency, splinter into factions and engage in finger pointing ... all in one meeting.

       " Netflix took a swipe at Chris Christie, even though \"Duplicitous Republican administration featuring a strong male lead\" is almost certainly a category on the company’s streaming service. The U.S. Senate is working so hard on VA reform you'd think there was an idling Escalade downstairs ready to go to the airport. And Republicans control every Confederate statehouse for the first time since the end of Reconstruction, when, if we recall correctly, voter ID laws successfully rooted out election fraud.

Tom Cotton won’t impeach President Obama because it’d “make Joe Biden president,” to which the vice president responded by sticking an “impeach this!” sign on Cotton’s back, slicking his hair and yelling “c’mon, gang we don’t need him!” while walking away.

       " D.C. residents are bracing for the impending blizzard like any normal people would: cracking snowquester jokes and placing overnight orders for a Settlers of Catan expansion pack. Congress is taking Monday off, and also leaving early today to buy an extra can of beans that will remain in the congressional cupboard for several years. And Senate Democrats hope to lift research bans on gun violence.

       " Dick Cheney criticized the administration's handling of Benghazi, probably because he thinks the relief forces it never sent would have been greeted as liberators. Food stamp benefits will shrink for 47 million Americans next month, which is either an embarrassing failure of government or a terrible way to combat the obesity epidemic.

HuffPost Arts recently spoke to Brian DiFeo, the founder of Instagram NYC and the curator, about the exhibition. In our phone interview, he admitted that \"gallery spaces are hard to come by,\" but that the W Hotel in Times Square offered the space after DiFeo worked on a project with them. When asked what unites the Instagrammers in this exhibition, he said, \"The photographs really show the different elements of design in New York City: architecture, street art, patterns, and design.\"                                                                                                                                                                                                              1   \n",

       " Mike Allen will leave Politico next year, presumably to do penance for asking about Rahm Emanuel’s vacation. A House panel investigating the Flint water crisis didn’t subpoena Rick Snyder -- perhaps he was too busy not doing anything about it. And the government said more than twenty of Hillary Clinton’s emails contained top secret information, a scandal that will culminate four years from now in a really, REALLY boring Michael Bay film.

       " Donald Trump’s campaign staff is becoming increasingly paranoid, and when you consider what Hillary Clinton did to Vince Foster, can you blame them? The Trump-Sanders debate won't happen, even though the one they had during a 2008 fever dream we suffered was absolutely stellar. And Monday is Memorial Day, when Trump will try not to think too much about all those loser fighter pilots who’ve been shot down.

       " The House won a major victory in America's ongoing obesity epidemic when it voted to cut $40 billion from nutrition programs. Ted Cruz made sense, though it remains unclear how Tea Party activists will punish him for doing so. And conservative activists will urge college students not to enroll in Obamacare, because if there's one thing a group of people who have multiple sex partners and play Edwards 40-hands *don't* need, it's health insurance.

       " Nancy Pelosi danced to \"It's Raining Men\" at Barney Frank's wedding, but Steny Hoyer's refusal to do the Bernie rendered the event a total failure. We all know that Congress is full of hot air but if a Senate office building isn't updated to meet fire safety standards, that might literally be so. And a Washington lobbying shop is hosting a \"white trash reception,\" which probably means prosecco will be served in lieu of champagne.

       " Donald Trump may use the exposure of his campaign to launch a media network, hopefully with the tagline, \"We Report, You Won't Believe How Amazing This Reporting Will Be; It'll Blow Your Mind, Folks.\" John McCain *blamed* President Obama for the Orlando attacks, but it's important to remember that McCain is a statesman because he doesn't think President Obama *sympathizes with the attackers.* And staunch Bernie Sanders supporter Raúl Grijalva endorsed Hillary Clinton, something that could have been avoided if the Democratic Party allowed open Raúl Grijalvas and let independents participate in its Raúl Grijalvas.

       " Rick Santorum shamed Catholics who benefit from Obamacare but stopped short of telling children they'll grow hair on their palms if they stay on their parents' health plans. Mitt Romney explained his health care policies on a whiteboard, which is a rectangular object used for impermanent drawing and writing ... y'know, like an Etch-a-Sketch. And Americans learned a valuable lesson about expectations when a fantastically rich business executive announced he only paid 13 percent in federal taxes and, satisfied by that news, everyone moved on.

The U.S. plans to hurl an asteroid at the moon, probably in an attempt to frack it.  And Vance McAllister, clearly in need of a crisis management team, wants the FBI to investigate the video leak of him making out with a staffer. Whether he'll dare the cable news networks to develop a specialty chyron for his scandal remains to be seen.

       " Donald Trump keeps saying we don’t have any good trade deals, but tell that to the guy in Massachusetts who just got a penis transplant. Trump and David Cameron are in the midst of a trans-Atlantic feud, exhibiting the sort of intra floppy-haired-white-guy hostility usually only found during a prep school lacrosse match. And the House offered up a meager response to the Zika virus -- less than half what the administration asked for but definitely enough to lecture women in tropical climates to practice abstinence and tell their immune systems to buck up and get a job.

With Britain now a free agent, the world eagerly waits to see if the Organization of American States will make a ten-year offer, with a trade deal to be named later.

The White House confirmed that it won't use drones to kill Americans on American soil, something Americans have proved more than capable of doing on their own.

Someone in San Bernardino shot a lot of people, something that will keep happening until we stop making excuses and once and for all block people displaced by war from immigrating here. And while the shooting will undoubtedly add fuel to the ongoing debate over gun control, we can proudly announce that our Kickstarter campaign to end gun violence has reached its stated goal of 35,000 thoughts and prayers.

Regardless of your taste in cuisine, chances are you've found yourself at a casual dining restaurant before, whether one is your go-to Friday night spot or a road trip-only meal. These national chains pride themselves on creating a menu that can appeal to a wide variety of eaters. But are these calorie-heavy appetizers worth it?

       " John Kerry's Forrest Gump diplomacy continued as the secretary of state wiped his face with a T-shirt, producing a smear shaped exactly like a chemical weapons ban treaty. Congressman Steve Stockman said he will support action against Syria if President Obama returns his Nobel Prize -- though it has to be the long form one. And New Yorkers head to the polls today to help decide which person will cave to real estate developers, make the homeless go away and tell them how much soda they can drink.

       " The Senate passed the \"Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act of 2013\" while the House readied its alternate proposal, the \"Texas' Electoral Votes Are Overrated, Anyway Act of 2013.\" The White House is vetting replacements for Ben Bernanke, though the only guy we can think of with a really thin beard and strong interest in finances is the TaxMasters dude. And Texas executed its 500th prisoner this week, meaning the next batch of potassium chloride is on the house. It pays to be a loyal customer.

       " John Boehner observed that there aren't a lot of \"females\" in his conference... then told his bros that the scene was way better at Smith Point and peaced out. Joe Barton believes that the minimum wage has \"outlived its usefulness,\" probably because people no longer need to eat food.  And Bill de Blasio named a former Giuliani police commissioner as the next head of the NYPD. Fears that de Blasio would turn New York into some kind of urban hellscape where the Zuccotti Park protesters are given pensions, the squeegee men unionize and Dan Smith will no longer teach you guitar have not panned out.

And maybe it's just us, but as congressional Republicans strain to find something redeeming in Trump, their statements are reminding us more and more of interviews with death row inmates' mothers.

       " A new poll finds Mitt Romney leading 2016 contenders among Iowa Republicans; a deep dive into the crosstabs finds the news cycle is really, really slow.  An older senator once told Kirsten Gillibrand, \"Don't lose too much weight now. I like my girls chubby,\" and then presumably told her to \"be a doll\" and vote for his appropriations measure. And during a trip to New Hampshire, Rick Perry said he's \"not a lawyer\" so he doesn't \"really understand the details\" of his indictment. He then went back to campaigning to be the most powerful lawmaker in the world.

       " Spencer Bachus' weak attempts at humor make Ben Quayle seem ready for Catch A Rising Star. George Allen thinks all black people play sports, meaning he's probably the only person alive who believes Neil deGrasse Tyson could win a pick-up game of anything. Staffers are readying for a shutdown by choosing which golf ball they want Vijay Singh to sign. And If some members of Congress are to be believed, a government shutdown will not only harm our troops and result in the massacre of thousands of innocent civilians, but probably lead to a Nazi invasion of the continental U.S. Good to know!

       " A second Coalition of the Willing is forming to combat ISIS, but it’s unclear who is on mine-clearing monkey duty. One Republican House member wants all of America’s generals to quit en masse -- like an old warrior once said, old generals don't die, they simply appear on Fox News to lambast our defeatist president. And Ted Cruz doesn't want the Senate to confirm Eric Holder's replacement during the lame duck session, presumably so the president can't push through the implementation of 2Fast2Furious.

       " The CIA official who helped edit the Benghazi talking points is retiring, but don't expect him to receive a gold watch the next time he appears before the House Oversight Committee. Republican Rep. Trent Franks should learn to love the phrase \"incidence of rape\" because it's going to show up in his Google results for a looooong time. And Ted Cruz is convinced people don't pay attention to deficits because \"trillion,\" \"billion\" and \"million\" rhyme.

       " Todd Akin's pollster compared the beleaguered candidate to David Koresh, though we're not sure if that's worse than his Phyllis Schlafly endorsement. The government has significantly increased its monitoring of Americans' internet activity, which we think explains the spotty delivery of HuffPost Hill. And a poll finds Mitt Romney is less popular than George W. Bush, which make sense when you realize that Romney *enjoys* firing people and Bush simply fired people because he was a terrible businessman.

       " Rep. Jeff Duncan says he can’t be a racist because he had a black roommate, which, as a way of proving his civil rights bona fides, is only a step up from saying he watched “12 Years A Slave” and shook his head disapprovingly. Until today, we hadn’t realized that “The Depths of Bobby Jindal’s Self Loathing” would be a great name for a Smith’s song, but then the son of immigrants closed his state to Syrian refugees. And Steve King said Ted Cruz is “the candidate who is the answer to my prayers, the candidate who God will use to restore the soul of America,” which is probably what Ted Cruz says every time he looks in a mirror.

       " Rand Paul got testy with Savannah Guthrie and refused to elaborate a position on reproductive rights, echoing the sentiments on his campaign website, a 1950s pamphlet on female hygiene titled “You’re A Young Lady Now.” Bobby Moynihan is presumably putting the final touches on his SNL skit, “Chris Christie yells at bright-eyed young children,” after a teacher confronted the New Jersey governor about his manners. And John McCain met with a group of Arizona Cardinal cheerleaders, reminding us that “really old politicians posing with cheerleaders” is one of our favorite political photo-ops, second-only to “well-coiffed politician in yellow hard hat.” This is HUFFPOST HILL for Wednesday, April 8th, 2015                                                                                           1   \n",

       " A protestors uses a slingshot against Turkish riot police on Taksim square on June 11, 2013. Riot police fired tear gas and rubber bullets to clear protesters from an Istanbul square on June 11 as Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan warned he would show \"no more tolerance\" for the unrelenting mass demonstrations against his Islamic-rooted government. Hundreds of police stormed the city's Taksim Square, the epicenter of nearly two weeks of unrest, in the early morning and brought bulldozers to clear the makeshift barriers erected by demonstrators after police pulled out of the area on June 1.

       " Note from the Editor: \\nMartin Luther King, Jr. was a great preacher, orator and writer. He knew the power of words to challenge and inspire individuals and society.  Words lead to actions, and in King's case, words provided a pathway to racial reconciliation and the cornerstones for building a more just American society.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             1    \n",
